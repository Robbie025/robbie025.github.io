title: "Reflections on the Ariane 5 Crash Report and Lessons for Modern Software System"
---
The Ariane 5 crash report is a fascinating read that explores the technical causes behind the rocket's failure. Before reading it, I hadn’t realized that the explosion was a deliberate mitigation measure (self-destruct) triggered because the rocket was heading toward a populated area of French Guiana.

This report is a classic example of how to conduct a thorough post-accident investigation. It continues to be referenced in safety-critical domains even in 2025. One of the key takeaways is the growing argument for adopting memory-safe programming languages—such as Rust or Java—over traditional choices like C or C++. This shift aims to prevent entire classes of bugs by enforcing type and memory safety at compile time.

While I still have questions about how much these new tools can improve system security and reliability, some sources suggest that memory-safe languages can eliminate many common bugs. Interestingly, the Ariane 5 failure was due in part to a reused software module from a previous mission. The function that failed was not even necessary for Ariane 5, highlighting a failure in both requirements specification and software reuse strategy.

This raises a broader question: what additional methods can help us manage risks in increasingly complex software systems? Simpler systems are easier to analyze manually, but modern systems—like those in automotive safety—are often more complex than space systems from the 1980s.

One promising alternative to traditional failure analysis (e.g., FMEA) is the systems-theoretic approach by Nancy Leveson, where the emphasis is on control structures rather than isolated component failures. While I agree with this perspective, I still wonder: how would this method have prevented the Ariane 5 failure? The incident involved both a flawed requirement for the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a critical error in data type conversion—two separate issues, both with systemic implications.
